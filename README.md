## Challenge overview
 The purpose of this challenge was to do the same thing we did for voter count for candidates but for voter counts to specific counties.
## Challenge Summary
 To use this program for any election I would suggest changing two things. One in the list of definitions we provide. When we are going through each row of a .csv file make sure you are reading the right column information in the respective .csv file. I would also suggest putting in code to delineate between candidate's political parties in case that were information provided in a .csv file.
